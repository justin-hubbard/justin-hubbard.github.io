#### I've always loved the brevity of haikus, so I started an instagram for sharing the ones I come up with. Quickly however, making the images became ugly and tedious, so I wrote a web service hosted on a Raspberry Pi so I could text haikus and receive a nicely formatted image to post.

I've had a Raspberry Pi for a while now, and while I've explored a number of projects with motors, cameras, small programs, etc, I never settled on a long-term function for it. When I started my haiku account, I realized that having my Pi run a web service for sending me images would be perfect. 

The way this all works is pretty simple. First, I set up a Twilio account so I can send and receive SMS messages. When it receives an SMS, it sends a POST message to a URL established by running ngrok on the Raspberry Pi. From there, I run a small flask app that waits for a message to come in.

When I want to create a new haiku image, I send a text to the number I set up with one line of the haiku per line in the message. When that message finds its way to the flask app, it creates and formats a pleasant looking image, then sends the image back to my phone through Twilio.

This is the flask app:

{% highlight python %}
import requests
from flask import Flask
from flask import request, redirect
from flask import send_from_directory

from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse
from twilio.rest import Client
from twilio import twiml

import picturemaker

# Srnd back account setup
account_sid = "xxxx"
auth_tok = "xxxx"

#client = Client( account_sid, auth_tok)
#########################

UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/FILEPATH'

app = Flask(__name__)
#app.config

#def send_image(recipient_num):

@app.route('/sms', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def sms():
    #print("sms started")
    response = MessagingResponse()

    body = request.form['Body']

    if request.form['Body'] != '/0':
        print("Body of the text: ", body)
    else:
        print("It didn't work!!")

    #response.message("Successful text! (Message: {}".format(body))

    filename = request.form['MessageSid'] + '.png'
    picturemaker.generate_image(body, filename)
    with response.message() as message:
        message.body = "{0}".format("Here's your haiku")
        message.media('http://80b7dcaf.ngrok.io/uploads/{}'.format(filename))
    
    return str(response)

@app.route('/uploads/<filename>', methods=['GET','POST'])
def uploaded_files(filename):
    return send_from_directory(UPLOAD_FOLDER, filename)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
{% endhighlight %}

All in all, pretty simple stuff:
- App get message
- Code magic turns message into spiffy image
- App sends that thang back to my phone

Here's the magic that makes the images:
{% highlight python %}
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
import random
import datetime as dt

def get_lum(rgb):
    lum = (rgb[0]*0.299 + rgb[1]*0.587 + rgb[2]*0.114)
    return lum

def get_background():
    print(dt.datetime.now().hour)
    if dt.datetime.now().hour+16 > 3 & dt.datetime.now().hour+16 < 24:
        mix = (255,255,255)
    else:
        mix = (0,0,0)

    (r, g, b) = (random.randint(0,256), random.randint(0,256), random.randint(0,256))
    (r, g, b) = ((r+mix[0])/2,(g+mix[1])/2,(b+mix[2])/2)

    return (r,g,b)

def get_rect(rgb):
    if dt.datetime.now().hour+16 > 10 & dt.datetime.now().hour+16 < 24:
        lum = (int(get_lum(rgb))+255)/2
    else:
        lum = (int(get_lum(rgb))+255)/2
    return (lum, lum, lum)

def get_text_color(rgb):
    lum = int(get_lum(rgb))

    if lum > 100:
        return (0,0,0)
    else:
        return (255,255,255)

def generate_image(message, filename):
    # Image size
    (cW, cH) = (1024, 1024)

    font = ImageFont.truetype('AppleGaramond.ttf', size=70)

    # Find longest line, calculate dimensions
    lines = message.split("\n")
    long = max(lines, key=len)
    (w, h) = font.getsize(long)
    (offset_x, offset_y) = font.getoffset(long)
    hH = h*3
    ascent, descent = font.getmetrics()
    diff = descent - offset_y

    padding = 50

    # Top left corner
    (x,y) = ((cW-w)/2, (cH-hH)/2)

    # Generate colors
    bg = get_background()
    rect = get_rect(bg)
    lum = get_lum(bg)
    color = get_text_color(rect)

    #Create image and draw rectangle and text
    image = Image.new("RGB", (cW, cH), bg)
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
    draw.rectangle([(x-padding,y + offset_y - padding), ((x+w)+padding, (y+hH-descent)+padding-10)], fill=rect)
    draw.text((x,y), message, fill=color, font=font)

    # Save image to file
    print('uploads/{}'.format(filename))
    image.save('uploads/{}'.format(filename))
{% endhighlight %}

Picturemaker here makes haiku images based on very particular specifications: pastel background, monochrome box in the middle, Apple Garamond text in the middle.

All this pretty code makes sure the proportions of the box and text are nicely centered based on the length of the longest line of the haiku, generates a random pastel background color, and decides white-on-grey or black-on-white based on the time of day that the haiku was sent. It also does some nifty calculations based on how eyes perceive light so that everything is nice and visible.

Here's some haikus for ya:
