#### I've always loved the brevity of haikus, so I started an instagram for sharing the ones I come up with. Quickly however, making the images became ugly and tedious, so I wrote a web service hosted on a Raspberry Pi so I could text haikus and receive a nicely formatted image to post.

I've had a Raspberry Pi for a while now, while I've explored a number of projects with motors, cameras, small programs, etc, I never settled on a long-term function for it. When I started my haiku account, I realized that having my Pi run a web service for sending me images would be perfect.
