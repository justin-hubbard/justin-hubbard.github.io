#### A concept for an intuitive, readable app that would assist elderly users in managing their lives

I took a class called Gerontechnology which was centered around assistive technology for the elderly. As we all know,
they have a variety of additional difficulties as a result of the things that come with old age, so our focus was
on what those difficulties are and how technology can help. Our end of semester project was to develop a concept
product based on a particular concept. Our group was chosen to work on designing a Dynamic Memory Notebook. This has
traditionally been a pen and paper tool for keeping track of appointments, medications, chores, meals, etc. so that
individuals with memory problems can record things instead of relying on remembering large amounts of information.

Like many pen and paper tools, there is a clear benefit to adding tech to make the process simpler and more automatic.
Our group identified the crucial functionality like calendar keeping, medication lists, allergy records, and to-do lists
and began working on a way to arrange these functions into a tablet application. Tablets are especially good for the elderly
because text and buttons can be larger than smartphones. Of course, a mobile app could do all the same things, but for this project
we focused on home use which a tablet is perfectly suited for. It also left room for potential smart home integration which was
a large portion of the course's focus.

I was tasked with doing the graphic design concepts for the application, and I've included the example screenshots below:

### ACTIVE LIFE

This is the page that a user would be presented upon opening the app. Our working name for the app was "Active Life" which is
meant to be uplifting and positive, making it clear that the goal is to enable a life without avoidable problems. The design language
includes large buttons with drop shadow that are easy to see and have a large area to tap. Each button also includes a large, clear icon
and large text so that each button's function is obvious.

After tapping the first button, the user is taken to the calendar page. Like most calendar apps, it includes the ability to view events in
a day view, week view, or month view. Here, the day view is shown. As time goes on, earlier times are grayed out so the user knows where they are
in the day. More work is certainly needed to make each hour or half hour seem more distinct, which would remove the need for redundant labels for event times. This functionality is perfect for older users because it can incorporate things like medication schedules into the one calendar that they use.

Keeping relevant data is very important to older individuals who may need medical attention at home at any time. Many will have bracelets with
data like blood type, medications, allergies, etc, but the app would be able to store much for information like recent vitals, emergency contacts, and
recent medical procedures. This is also where they would input a lot of their data for the app.

The to-do list functionality is probably the most important part of the application. It functions like any other to-do list, but it
also auto-populates with items from the calendar and from the medications list, so the user has to do less work to remember everything for the day.
Anything that removes pressure for the user to use their memory is essential, and a to-do list is the obvious starting place.

This course and this project were the first opportunities I had to learn about and work on assistive technology, and sparked a passion
that I carried on into my senior design Assistive Wheelchair project. I hope that I am able to work with accessibility and assitive tech
as a part of my career at some point.
