#### For a while I've had an idea for a platforming mobile game, so I designed some charater and level concepts to explore the art direction.

I've always enjoyed 2D sidescrollers, and one day I had an idea for a constantly scrolling game where you play as a blob who can take different forms
with different abilities. In exploring this idea, and as some art practice, I drew some possible designs for the character and some concepts for levels
with fun themes.
