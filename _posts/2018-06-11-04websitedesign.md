#### The default theme for github.io sites is nice and minimal, but that's not how I roll, so I made a change or two.

Resumes are cool, but people like websites. I know this because I polled myself and then extrapolated that data to apply to everyone. Luckily for me, github lets you host websites for free, so I started one. To begin, it looked like this:

The default theme is called Minima. It's fine. Perfectly adequate. But I'm not big on adequacy, so I changed basically everything. As you've seen if you got this far, it looks like this now:

As everyone agrees, dark themes are the best. I started by making everything grey. Then I said to myself, everyone also loves card-based interfaces, so I wrapped everything in slightly darker grey boxes and added some drop shadow for a real spiffy 3D effect. Depth is great.

"But what about color?"

You're likely asking yourself this question. Well I was asking myself the same question while eating from a pre-cut melon mix that I purchased in a single-use plastic containeer (boo) from Safeway. I looked beneath my face and noticed a gorgeous trio of colors. Watermelon. Cantaloupe. Honeydew. So pastel. So trendy.

Unfortunately, the watermelon color is basically illegible on the dark gray background, so it was regelated to the text color for visited links. That seemed like a decent consolation. Meanwhile, cantaloupe and honeydew are thriving throughout the site. Making appearances in such exhaulted elements as the header bar, link text, and subheading text.

For some examples, either look at your screen right now, or at these images below, which are undoubtedly redundant:

Hopefully this gives an idea of interfaces I like looking at. 

Simple, yet edgy. Stunning, yet understated. Professional, yet playful.
