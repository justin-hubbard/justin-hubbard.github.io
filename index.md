As you can see at the top of the page, my name is Justin Hubbard. I love computers a lot. I use them
for as much of everything as I can. If I could make dinner with a computer somehow, I'd already be doing it. I figured I might as well get a computery degree, so I got a BS in Computer Science from Washington State University, an experience I enjoyed greatly but do not wish to repeat. I spend much of my free time making music on a computer, which I like to think I'm pretty decent at. I hope the contents of my portfolio express that I'm a competent programmer who also likes to make
dumb canvas apps that draw circles.
